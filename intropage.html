		<h1> About </h1>
		<p> My goal for this project is to educate native New Yorkers and those new to and/or unfamiliar with the city so that they have a deeper understanding of the wide variety of species of birds that are native to Manhattan— specifically, Riverside Park.  While everyone who has been to New York has likely seen pigeons and sparrows, there are many other fascinating and uncommon birds that either nest in or migrate through New York.  The New York Audubon Society estimates that within “the last thirty years, 177 species of birds have been seen in or around” Riverside Park.</p>
