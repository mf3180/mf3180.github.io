		<h1> About </h1>
		
		<p> This project consists of a series of audio effects that can be applied to a given audio sample in real time.  There are separate pages, linked to on the home page, where you can alter a given audio sample using a ping-pong delay, a reverb effect, and a bandpass filter.  

		My goal for this project was to create a series of effects that allow people unfamiliar with audio effects and manipulation to be able to experiment with and learn more about the parameters of these effects.
